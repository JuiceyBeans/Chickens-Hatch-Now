# Chickens Hatch Now
Ever thought throwing eggs to hatch chickens was stupid? Well hey, that's why this mod exists!

How does it work? Why, simply plonk down a chicken egg (or two, or three, or four!) on top of a hay block! In about 9 minutes, a baby chicken will hatch!

This mod also makes it so that throwing chicken eggs does NOT hatch them anymore (can be turned off in config)

The time taken to progress 1 hatching stage can be configured as well (default: 180 seconds)

## Todo
- [x] Fix ThrownEggMixin for compat with other mods
- [ ] Use block tag for egg hatching instead

## Known bugs
- Eggs don't do damage to entities when thrown
